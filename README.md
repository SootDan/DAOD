# Dungeons And/Or Dragons 5e
## Video Demo:
TBD

## Description
There are a lot of Dungeons & Dragons programs out there but a lot of them 
work on outdated knowledge as well as being full of ads or require a monthly 
subscription. So I made my own.  
The program features customizable dice rolls with unique character sheets. 
Users may save or load their own files; they interact client side only.  
Each character sheet has the character's basic info and stats. Dice roll 
modifiers are automatically applied on each roll.  
One can also create a campaign sheet detailing everything the party has 
encountered so far.  
The program abides by the [Wizards of the Coast's Fan Content Policy]
(https://company.wizards.com/en/legal/fancontentpolicy).

## Current Features:

## Current Bugs:

### Documentation
I started out making classes for player entities. These entail information 
about the character's name, race, class, level, etc. and will serve as a 
baseline for the GUI.  
The next few commits, I decided to put more priority into coding a menu that 
includes saving and loading the game.
