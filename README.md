# Dungeons And/Or Dragons 5e
## Video Demo:
TBD

## Description
There are a lot of Dungeons & Dragons programs out there but a lot of them work on outdated knowledge as well as being full of ads or require a monthly subscription. So I made my own.
The program features customizable dice rolls with unique character sheets. Users may save or load their own files; they interact client side only.
Each character sheet has the character's name, their pronouns, and stats. Dice roll modifiers are automatically applied on each roll.
One can also create a campaign sheet detailing everything the party has encountered so far.
The program abides by the [Wizards of the Coast's Fan Content Policy](https://company.wizards.com/en/legal/fancontentpolicy).

### Documentation
I started out making classes for player entities. These entail information about the character's name, race, class, level, etc. and will serve as a baseline for the GUI.
